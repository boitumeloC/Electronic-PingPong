implementation of an Electronic Ping Pong Game using PIC16f877A microcontroler

Ping pong is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small bats. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball. The player who reaches 15 first wins.
Electronic Ping Pong Game Play
In this project, an electronic ping pong game using a PIC16F877A microcontroller and LED lights is created. In the circuit, the movement of the ball is indicated in the successive lighting of the LED which light up temporarily one after the other.  Bat swings are simulated using push buttons. If a player presses the buttons too early or too late a score is awarded to the opponent. If a player presses the paddle for too long a score is awarded to the opponent.
